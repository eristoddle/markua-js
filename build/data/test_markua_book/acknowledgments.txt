# Acknowledgments

I ([Peter Armstrong](https://twitter.com/peterarmstrong)) am the creator of Markua, but I'm getting lots of help.

First, a huge thanks to [Scott Patten](https://twitter.com/scott_patten), my co-founder at Ruboss and Leanpub. Scott is the lead developer of Leanpub's book generation engine. Leanpub Flavoured Markdown would not have existed without Scott's code. Furthermore, Scott is providing valuable feedback in the development of the Markua specification, as well as adding Markua support to Leanpub's book generation engine. Scott is giving me opinionated feedback on the Markua syntax, just as Aaron Swartz gave John Gruber feedback on the Markdown syntax. In many instances, e.g. the poetry syntax, what happens is that I come up with an idea which is good but flawed, Scott points the flaws out and suggests an alternative which often feels like giving into the status quo or feels too much like programming, I get really mad, and then I come up with something better than I would have otherwise. So, Markua probably also wouldn't exist if I couldn't--repeatedly and productively--get mad at Scott.

Second, a huge thanks to [Ken Pratt](https://twitter.com/ken_pratt), who made a number of key contributions to the development of Leanpub Flavoured Markdown and to Ruboss over his years working with us.

Next, an ongoing thanks to [Len Epp](https://twitter.com/lenepp), [Braden Simpson](https://twitter.com/bradensimpson) and [Jordan Ell](https://twitter.com/jordanelltweets), who have been instrumental in the development of Leanpub. Len has been with us since the very early days, and has greatly helped our customer development process, helping (as he likes to tease me) grow Leanpub over 100x since joining us. Braden and Jordan are proving key in helping Scott, Len and me to bring Leanpub--and Markua--to the next order of magnitude of success, including doing great work on the open source JavaScript-based (ES6) reference implementation of the parser and the Markuapad editor.

I'm getting great feedback on Twitter as well. Of particular note are the contributions of [Iva Cheung](https://twitter.com/IvaCheung), [Assaf Arkin](https://twitter.com/assaf), [Axel Rauschmayer](https://twitter.com/rauschma) and [Michael MÃ¼ller](https://twitter.com/muellermi). Iva helped us figure out how to think about front matter, main matter and back matter properly, and she also organizes a Vancouver publishing unconference that I've had the pleasure of both speaking at and of sponsoring. I know Assaf from my Silicon Valley days: Assaf was the CTO of Intalio for the four years that I was a developer there. Assaf is probably the smartest technologist that I have ever worked with (sorry Ken!), and his interest in Markua and his feedback during its development were both motivating and helpful. Axel was really helpful to me in an email thread that we had, which was the catalyst for me to rethink my goals with Markua and to start throwing out more than I had planned to from Leanpub Flavoured Markdown. Michael was key in convincing me to add index entry support to Markua.

Perhaps most important, Markua is benefiting from years of feedback about Leanpub Flavoured Markdown from Leanpub authors. If it wasn't for Leanpub authors, there would be no Markua.

I'd also like to thank [Justin Damer](https://twitter.com/damerdamer). Justin and I designed the logo for Markua together, just as we designed the Leanpub logo together. I've never enjoyed working with a designer more than I enjoy working with Justin.

Finally, I would like to thank my wife Caroline and my son Evan: while this is not as long as one of my normal books, there's still a lot of thought and effort going into it, and a lot of sacrifice. As always, it is very much appreciated.
